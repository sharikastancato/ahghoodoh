I used to believe that Eddard Stark was a noble if flawed man who suffered greatly because his sense of honor and moral code, which was his greatest asset, was also his greatest weakness, because his upbringing in the Vale created a unique perspective and method for dealing with his family, subordinates and enemies.

These are thoughts that have arisen out of watching the current season of Star Trek: Discovery , and years and years of arguing about comic book movies with my dad (who is of the opinion that there exists a single "right" version of everything, invariably what it was from roughly 1963-1970). And I'm strictly talking about universes that come from many authors here, principally Star Trek, Star Wars, Marvel, and DC. Basically, what I've come to realize is that insistence upon adherence to canon.

However, I had a thought on a different kind of prejudice: Weapons Prejudices. Basically, the basis of the subject's intollerance and outspoken disdain is based upon weapons. This can include the weapon itself and upon the person using or dealing the weapon: Brand Diehard : For you, only one brand is worth respecting. Used in conjunction with the Brand Loyalty quality, a brand diehard has no respect for anyone. Скачивайте игры для Sony Playstation 4 через торрент бесплатно и без регистрации.

One of the bigger Kentucky Derby prep races that takes place this weekend is our highlighted race; the  million, nine furlong, Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park. The entire card at Gulfstream is huge, as it includes seven other Stakes races. Of these, we will be looking at four. The Gulfstream Park Mile, the Gulfstream Park Oaks for three year old fillies and the marathon Pan American Stakes. Elsewhere, we move west for a look at three races at Santa Anita Park. They include the Grade: This is clearly one of the biggest weekends of the year in the sport of Horse Racing. Up until the last few days, I had no less than 17 races circled as races which loom large and should be looked at. Obviously, that’s too many, so I knocked it down to eight. I’m not sure which should be our highlighted race of the week as it could be any one of four. The Wood Memorial at Aqueduct in New York, the Bluegrass Stakes in Kentucky, the Santa Anita Derby, (all final and major Kentucky Derby Hey guys, some context for this one: //BEGIN CONTEXT In my club, everyone loves D&D but only me and one other guy have ever heard of Shadowrun. Still, we've managed to sell some friends on the setting, and since I'm the only one who's GMed Shadowrun before, I'm going to be running a SR One-Shot at a friend's birthday party. Here's the thing though - none of them wanted to use premade characters, nor do they want to create characters on their own without help. Told them it would I'm in the middle of rereading the series, and just when I thought there was nothing left to discover, I stumbled upon the realization that I had completely misinterpreted something Tywin says to Tyrion in A Storm of Swords  > "It would have been kinder to leave her with a bastard in her belly," said Tyrion bluntly. The Westerlings stood to lose everything here; their lands, their castle, their very lives. A Lannister always pays his debts. > "Jeyne Westerling is her mother's daugh. Hello, I'm Howard Andrew Jones. I've written sword-and-sorcery, historical fantasy, and Pathfinder novels, and the first book of my new trilogy, For the Killing of Kings (https://read.macmillan.com/lp/for-the-killing-of-kings/), launches today, courtesy of the fine folks at St. Martin's. When I'm not writing, I'm usually editing. I served as the Managing Editor of Black Gate magazine for many years, and now edit the sword-and-sorcery magazine Tales From the Magician's Skull (http://good. I'm looking for a series with a Knight as a/the main character. Classic full plate armor type guy/gal. I'm fine either a standard heroic knight in shining armor or a pragmatic antihero knight (or even a villainous knight), but they should be badass; 99% of the time, I can't stand wimpy MCs. I'd also prefer that the MC usually wear armor, be physically strong, and be charismatic (the last one especially if they're a heroic knight). If heroic, they should follow a code of honor or morals. Another small QoL improvement, but one that could really use being in the game. Overwatch is an example of where this works, being healed and throwing out a quick thank you. I know a lot of people take that stuff too seriously and treat it like a code of honor that has to be followed, but I'd only want it for two reasons. 1) It would be a small incentive for people to actually go revive one another, as they'll feel more appreciated for it. That's why I mention Overwatch specifically, a quick. Blah blah dead horse, whatever. I'm unoriginal. I get it. Ah, three evil stooges of Fates. Garon, Iago, and Hans are evil to a borderline comedic fashion and spend much of Conquest torturing Corrin. While I think everybody and their mom hate Garon because of his disappointing role in the story, a lot of people are cool with Iago and Hans, being the only villainous characters without any dumb dragon possession bullshit. Unfortunately I can't say I share that sentiment, at least OVERLORD: Side Adventures Vol.1 (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13253139/1/OVERLORD-Side-adventures-Jircniv) The first part to this story. \-------------------------------------------- CHAPTER ONE (https://www.reddit.com/r/overlord/comments/b9x07r/rough_draft_overlord_side_adventure_fanfic_vol2/) CHAPTER TWO (https://www.reddit.com/r/overlord/comments/b9z9db/rough_draftoverlord_side_adventure_fanfic_vol2/) CHAPTER 3: Punishment Lakyus quickly ate her lunch. 
Hey everyone, I’ve been wrestling with this post for the last couple of days trying to think of the best way to introduce myself, tell my story, and invite everyone on this entrepreneurial journey.

I was trying to get my head around the character creation system, and so I downloaded chummer and made this character named Kenshin. I'm a little worried that I min/maxed him too much and for the wrong things and that he won't be actually useful in game. Concept: Kenshin is what happens when a mall ninja lives in a world where people actually swing swords around for a living and he has magic power that let him be really good at it.

Just as “ Shoepick Lane" is an english-language homonym for a “ Choupique ” (a French or Cajun moniker for a “trash fish” that’s commercially harvested for its “valuable eggs”), the name “ Mary July ” (or “ Mary Julie, ” as she's also called in Ep. 6) is a “mistranslated” homonym of sorts for the REAL name that “secret princess” Julie Purcell was told belongs to her as a birthright: MARIE DU LYS  Once you understand the significance of that name, you’re on your way to figuring.
